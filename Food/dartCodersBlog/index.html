								<p>Hello, my name is Yiğit Eren Solmaz. I'm 15 years old now. I'm going to 10th grade. The high school I go to is Tuncay Azaphan Vocational Technical and Anatolian High School.  I am currently trying to increase my English level. I love coding, it is more fun than other jobs.  I am sure that I will improve my coding skills thanks to this project made by Insider and Kodluyoruz together. My dream is to become a computer engineer. I believe that I will improve myself in the field of coding in the future and come to better places.</p>

								<p>Hello, I'm Mustafa Alp Sahin! I'm 16 years old and I'm both a software engineering student and interested in mechatronics engineering. My interest in technology drew me into these two exciting fields. In this blog post, I would like to share with you why I discovered my passion for technology and the connection between these two disciplines.</p>
								<p>Software engineering is the foundation of the digital world. It can be seen as one of the powerful engines behind ubiquitous technological solutions such as computers, mobile apps and websites. Software development attracted me as a field where I can use my creativity and problem-solving skills. Learning the language of coding and solving real-world problems has been a great source of excitement for me.</p>
